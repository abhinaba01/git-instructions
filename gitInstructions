When you are unable to push changes to repository because your remote branch  has some other commits that you did not push.


1. Fetch changes from remote repository        git fetch origin
2. Merge the remote changes into local branch   git pull origin main -—rebase
3. If there are merge conflicts you need to merge them manually and then use this command  git add .
4. git rebase —-continue
5. Then we can push our changes to remote using   git push origin Abhinaba
