When you are unable to push changes to repository because your remote branch  has some other commits that you did not push.


1. Fetch changes from remote repository        git fetch origin
2. Merge the remote changes into local branch   git pull origin main -—rebase
3. If there are merge conflicts you need to merge them manually and then use this command  git add .
4. git rebase —-continue
5. Then we can push our changes to remote using   git push origin Abhinaba




When you want to merge changes in some other branch with your local and remote branch
In this scenario changes are in main but want to push them in abhinaba(local and remote)

1.git fetch origin main (This will fetch the latest changes from the remote main branch but will not apply them to your local branch yet.)
2.git checkout abhinaba 
  git merge origin/main  (this will merge main into abhinaba, creating a new merge commit.)
3.git push origin abhinaba (git push origin abhinaba) This will sync the changes in local and remote




 git remote rm origin // command for if you have mistakenly adding the wrong name of remote origin
